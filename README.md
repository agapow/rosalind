Solutions to the Rosalind bioinformatics course at http://rosalind.info/

The exercises - the initial ones anyway - border on trivial, but I'm doing this as practice in working my skills in Python, BioPython, bioinformatics and general programming. Some of the working out is documented in the code. In the future, I hope to extend my solutions to other programming languages (e.g. Ruby) and their respective BioFoo libraries.

Data files are saved in the "data" directory. However, these can vary across invocations of each problem, so you should always make sure you are working on the version of the dataset you downloaded. Solution scripts are executed from the top-level directory.
