Solutions to the Rosalind bioinformatics course at http://rosalind.info/

The exercises - the initial ones anyway - border on trivial, but I'm doing this as practice in working my skills in Python, BioPython, bioinformatics and general programming. Some of the working out is documented in the code. In the future, I hope to extend my solutions to other programming languages (e.g. Ruby) and their respective BioFoo libraries.

Data files are saved in the "data" directory (although I think these may vary across invocations of each problem). SOlution scripts are executed from the top-level directory.
