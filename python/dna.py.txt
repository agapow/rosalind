Exercise DNA
============

Calculate base frequency over a DNA string

The data is a raw string in a file, so reading it in is simple.

::

  in_hndl = open ('../data/rosalind_dna.txt', 'r')
  s = in_hndl.read()
  
There's many ways this could be done, but I've settled for the simple builtin
solution of using the string count function. For very long strings, it may be
worth using a dict and accumulating function along the string.

::

  result = ' '.join ([s.count(c) for c in 'ACGT']
  
Now just print the result. Note the results have to be printed out in a given order.

::

  print result
